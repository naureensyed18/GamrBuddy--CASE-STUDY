# 🎮 GamrBuddy – A Social Platform for Gamers to Find Teammates and Organize Matches  
# 🏆 Finalist at Microsoft Chhalaang 2.0 Hackathon (Top 10 of 500+ teams)

# 📌 Executive Summary  
GamrBuddy is a location-based social platform that helps gamers find and connect with nearby players based on shared gaming interests, skill levels, and availability. Developed during a 36-hour national hackathon, the platform aimed to solve the disconnect in real-time co-op gaming. As Product Manager, I led product definition, feature prioritization, and UX strategy, delivering an MVP that reached the hackathon finals.

#  🧠 Problem  
Multiplayer gamers struggle to find compatible, available teammates who play the same games and live nearby. Current solutions focus on global matchmaking, ignoring local community building and personalized connections — leading to frustration, low retention, and mismatched teams.

# 🎯 Objective  
Build an MVP that enables gamers to:
- Discover nearby teammates based on location  
- Match based on game tags, play style, and availability  
- Coordinate and chat in real time  

# 🔍 My Role – Product Manager  
- Conducted user research via Reddit and Discord to validate the problem  
- Defined MVP scope and created user stories, low-fidelity wireframes, and flows  
- Prioritized features using the MoSCoW method for delivery under 36 hours  
- Managed a team of 3 developers and led daily standups  
- Delivered the final pitch and demo to Microsoft judges
